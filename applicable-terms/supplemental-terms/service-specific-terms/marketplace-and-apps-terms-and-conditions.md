# Marketplace and Apps Terms and Conditions

Effective Date: November 30th, 2023

**At a glance:**

Welcome to Rocket.Chat Marketplace. Our Marketplace and Apps Terms and Conditions “Marketplace Terms” apply to all users of Rocket.Chat Marketplace and Apps.

Customers who utilize our Marketplace and install and enable either Rocket.Chat apps or third-party apps agree to comply with the Marketplace Terms. These Marketplace Terms are an addition to the Customer Terms of Service that apply to the Rocket.Chat Marketplace as part of the Customer Terms. In case of any conflict between the Marketplace Terms and the Customer Terms, the Customer Terms of Service shall take precedence.

Please note that Customers are solely responsible for ensuring they have read, understood, and agreed to any app and third-party app they install and enable from the Rocket.Chat Marketplace.&#x20;

1. **Orders.**&#x20;

You can place Orders on the Marketplace. Your Order will identify the Vendor, your authorized scope of use of the App, and license or subscription term, as applicable. Once you complete your order or enable or install the App, Rocket.Chat will provide you with access to the applicable Apps.&#x20;

2. **Third-Party Apps.**&#x20;

For any Third Party App, you agree that Rocket.Chat is the Vendor’s commercial agent, and you are required to make any related payments directly to Rocket.Chat, except where Third-Party Apps may be enabled or paid for through a third-party Vendor’s own website.

3. **App Licensing.**&#x20;

Apps are provided on a license or one-time paid or subscription basis, and you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Marketplace or the Apps. Rocket.Chat reserves the right to offer exclusive apps for certain plans.

4. **Term and Termination**

**4.1 Agreement Term**. The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) will begin on the Effective Date and continue until the Agreement is terminated as stated in Section 4 (Term and Termination).&#x20;

**4.2 Termination for Cause.** In the event of a material breach or any other grounds for termination for cause, as outlined in the Termination for Cause section of the Customer Terms of Service, either party reserves the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice, in accordance with applicable law.

**4.3 Effect of Termination.** If the Agreement is terminated, then (a) all rights and access to the Marketplace and Vendor Products will terminate, unless otherwise described in this Agreement, and (b) all Fees owed by Customer to Rocket.Chat are immediately due upon the Customer’s receipt of the final electronic bill or as set forth in the final invoice. If the Agreement terminates before the end of any outstanding subscription term for any Subscription Product for any reason other than Rocket.Chat’s uncured material breach in accordance with the Agreement, all unpaid Fees remaining for the duration of the subscription term will become due and payable upon termination.

**4.4 Termination of Trials.** The Marketplace may also offer free trial periods for Apps. After the expiration of the trial period, if you do not place an Order or install and enable the App, the App will cease to function, and you must cease using and delete your copies of the App.

5. **Marketplace Disclaimers and Liability**&#x20;

Except as expressly provided for in the Terms, Rocket.Chat does not make and expressly disclaims to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (a) any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, title, noninfringement, or error-free or uninterrupted use of the Marketplace and (b) any representations or warranties regarding any Vendor Products, including any representations or warranties,  even if Rocket.Chat has reviewed, certified, or approved the Third Party App. Vendors are solely responsible for the services, information and any related content or materials included in the Apps and services they provide (i) related to the performance, functionality, or security of any Vendor Products or (ii) that any Vendor Product listings in the Marketplace are accurate or up-to-date. Rocket.Chat expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability related to a Vendor’s provision of Vendor Products (including any related technical support) and any data shared with a Vendor in connection with these Terms or a Vendor Product. At any time, Rocket.Chat may remove an App from the Marketplace in accordance with applicable policies, and Vendors may also update, modify, or remove their own Apps at any time. Rocket.Chat makes no guarantee that any Apps will work properly with Rocket.Chat Products as they change over time.

6. **App Listing**

The listing for each App will identify the App provider (“Vendor”), which may be Rocket.Chat or a third party. Apps for which Rocket.Chat is the Vendor is "Rocket.Chat Apps,” and Apps for which the Vendor is a third party are “Third Party Apps”. Third-party apps are not Rocket.Chat Services and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms. We may enable interoperation of the Rocket.Chat Services with Third-Party Apps as set forth in these Marketplace Terms.

7. **Access to Data**

Data Handling and Usage of Third-Party Products and Services. You (including your End Users) may choose to use or procure other third-party products or services in connection with the Rocket.Chat Services, including Third Party Apps or implementation, customization, training, or other services. Your receipt or use of any third-party products or services (and the third parties’ use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third-party provider. If you enable or use third-party products or services with the Rocket.Chat Services (including third-party Apps), we will allow the third-party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Rocket.Chat Products. This may include transmitting, transferring, modifying, or deleting Your Data or storing Your Data on systems belonging to third-party providers or other third parties. Any third-party provider’s use of Your Data is subject to the applicable agreement between you and such third-party provider. We are not responsible for any access to or use of Your Data by third-party providers or their products or services or for the security or privacy practices of any third-party provider or its products or services. You are solely responsible for your decision to permit any third-party provider or third-party product or service to use Your Data. It is your responsibility to carefully review the agreement between you and the third-party provider, as provided by the applicable third-party provider. WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (WHETHER SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, OR OTHERWISE) OR FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OR VENDORS.
