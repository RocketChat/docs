# Custom domain for your Cloud-hosted workspace

Rocket.Chat Cloud allows you to set custom domains for registered [cloud-hosted workspaces](https://docs.rocket.chat/customer-center/cloud-services-center/rocket.chat-cloud-hosting-service-level-agreement-sla). However, it's important to note that if a custom domain encounters issues, there is currently no built-in redirect option.

**To set a custom domain,**

* Login to your cloud account.
* Click **Edit** next to your default URL

You're informed to await DNS verification, and your domain URL is currently showing a pending status. Typically, registrars finalize nameserver updates within 24 hours. Once this process is complete,  expect an email from Rocket.Chat Cloud. In the next guide, you'll learn how to optimize your Rocket.Chat cloud profile.
