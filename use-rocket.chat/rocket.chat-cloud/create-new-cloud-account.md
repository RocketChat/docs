# Create your new cloud account

After [deploying a new workspace](../../deploy/deploy-rocket.chat/), a registration wizard is prompted during [setup](../../setup-and-configure/accessing-your-workspace/rocket.chat-setup-wizard.md)  to connect your workspace to either an existing Rocket.Chat cloud account or a new cloud account. Alternatively, you can navigate to [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) and follow these steps to create a new account:&#x20;

1. Click **Create Account** to register your new Rocket.Chat cloud account.
2. Fill in the required information.
3. Accept Rocket.Chat's [Terms and Conditions](https://rocket.chat/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://rocket.chat/privacy).
4. Click **Next** and check your email for the confirmation link.
5. Confirm your email by clicking the link to activate your cloud account.
6. Your cloud account is now ready, and all your connected workspaces are displayed on the **Workspaces** screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
For [cloud-hosted workspaces](https://docs.rocket.chat/customer-center/cloud-services-center/rocket.chat-cloud-hosting-service-level-agreement-sla), a cloud account is automatically created for the customer when initiating your workspace with us for the first time.
{% endhint %}

Now that your Rocket.Chat cloud account is ready, we'll proceed to managing your Rocket.Chat cloud account and services.
