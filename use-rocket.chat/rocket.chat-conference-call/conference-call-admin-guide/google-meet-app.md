[Google Meet](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en\_in/products/meet/) is a video conferencing service from Google. It is an enterprise-grade, secure video conferencing solution that makes it easy for users to collaborate via one-to-one or group audio and video calls.

The **Google Meet** app in Rocket.Chat allows you to start a video call from within Rocket.Chat, without having to switch tools. The call encryption between all users ensures a secure video conference. For this integration to work, users are required to be logged in to their Google accounts.

**Key features of the Rocket.Chat - Google Meet integration**

* Start Google Meet calls from DMs, channels, teams, and discussions.
* Record and list call details to check users who joined the call.
* Ring users before initiating a call to provide a visual and audio indicator for them.
* Maintain a record of the call history.
