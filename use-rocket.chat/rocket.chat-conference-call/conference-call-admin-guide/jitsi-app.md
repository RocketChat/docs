# Jitsi app

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/architecture/) is a collection of open-source projects for voice, video conferencing, and instant messaging. Jitsi provides users with secure, scalable, and easy-to-use video conferencing platforms with state-of-the-art video quality and features. The [Jitsi Meet project](https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet) is a bandwidth-efficient WebRTC-compatible SFU (server-based) solution from our FOSS partner, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org).&#x20;

**Jitsi Meet** is a fully encrypted, open-source video conferencing solution that enables users to share screens and collaboratively edit documents together while video conferencing. It is browser-ready and doesnâ€™t require a client to install the application, as you can invite users via a custom URL.&#x20;

**Key features of the Rocket.Chat - Jitsi integration**

* Directly initiate calls from DMs, channels, teams, and discussions.
* Identify the moderator of the call automatically.
* Check user names and avatars before initiating a call

Here are a few additional features for our Enterprise plan:

* Record and list call details to check users who joined the call.
* Ring users before initiating a call to provide a visual and audio indicator for them.
* A record of the call history.

A [Jitsi server](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/) is required for this integration.

## Initiate calls using the Jitsi app

After successfully installing and configuring the Jitsi app, you can initiate a secure Jitis call inside any Rocket.Chat room by using the slash command `/jitsi` or the call icon in the room header.

Follow the [conference-call-users-guide.md](../conference-call-users-guide.md "mention") to start using it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using mobile apps to join a public server, Jitsi may redirect users to a browser to [complete authentication](https://jitsi.org/blog/authentication-on-meet-jit-si/) before joining calls. Users can choose to stay on the call screen within the app while waiting for another participant to log in, and then they can continue the call via their mobile app. However, if you're using a private Jitsi server, there's no need for anyone to sign in.
