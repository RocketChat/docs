# Jitsi app

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/architecture/) is a collection of open-source projects for voice, video conferencing, and instant messaging. Jitsi provides users with secure, scalable, and easy-to-use video conferencing platforms with state-of-the-art video quality and features. The [Jitsi Meet project](https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet) is a bandwidth-efficient WebRTC-compatible SFU (server-based) solution from our FOSS partner, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org).&#x20;

**Jitsi Meet** is a fully encrypted, open-source video conferencing solution that enables users to share screens and collaboratively edit documents together while video conferencing. It is browser-ready and doesnâ€™t require a client to install the application, as you can invite users via a custom URL.&#x20;

**Key features of the Rocket.Chat - Jitsi integration**

* Directly initiate calls from DMs, channels, teams, and discussions.
* Identify the moderator of the call automatically.
* Check user names and avatars before initiating a call

Here are a few additional features for our Enterprise plan:

* Record and list call details to check users who joined the call.
* Ring users before initiating a call to provide a visual and audio indicator for them.
* A record of the call history.

{% hint style="info" %}
This app can also work in a fully air-gapped environment. Follow the [Air-gapped App installation guide](../../../setup-and-configure/rocket.chat-air-gapped-deployment/air-gapped-app-installation.md) and continue with the configuration instructions below.
{% endhint %}

A [Jitsi server](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/) is required for this integration.

To download the **Jitsi** app on your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Administration > Apps > Marketplace**.
2. Search for the **Jitsi** app.
3. Click **Install**. Accept the terms and conditions and the required permissions.

## Set up the Jitsi app&#x20;

To set up the **Jitsi** app on your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Confirm that the app is enabled.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab and update the following fields according to your requirements:

<table><thead><tr><th width="310">Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td>Your Jitsi URL. For example, <code>jitsi.test.rocket.chat</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Title prefix</strong></td><td><p>Text that is added before the title when identifying a conference call URL. </p><p></p><p>For example, <code>https://jitsi.test.rocket.chat/RocketChat663b75818a8cfe91babdc15e</code>. Here <code>RocketChat</code> is the prefix. This is displayed in the URL and the call name when you join the call.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Title suffix</strong></td><td>Text that is added after the title when identifying a conference call.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use SSL</strong></td><td>Determines if the call URL uses <code>https</code> or <code>http</code>. Enable this option to use <code>https</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chrome Extension Id</strong></td><td>Enter the ID of an extension from Chrome's extension list. If the specified extension is installed on your browser, it is used to render the call instead of Jitsi's standard web interface.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use Authentication Token</strong></td><td><p>When enabled, Rocket.Chat will generate a JWT token. </p><p></p><p>You may configure Jitsi to require user authentication before allowing access to the calls. This authentication token is generated based on the rest of the parameters in this section, and the values for them must match the parameters configured in Jitsi.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Application ID (iss)</strong></td><td>The app ID to use when generating authentication tokens.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Application Secret</strong></td><td>The app secret to use when generating authentication tokens.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use JaaS (8x8)</strong></td><td>The provided URL is obtained from a JaaS provider like <a href="https://www.8x8.com/products/apis/video">8x8</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>The private key you downloaded in BASE64 encoded format</strong></td><td>Must be in base64 format to preserve the format, use <code>base64 -i ".pk file"</code> to get the base64 string.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8x8 API key id</strong></td><td>The API key ID you get from 8x8.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Limit token to Jitsi Room</strong></td><td>If enabled, generated tokens will grant access only to the intended Jitsi room.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Token Auditor</strong></td><td>The auditor's name to use when generating authentication tokens.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Token Expiration</strong></td><td>The expiring time of the authentication tokens.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Configure conference calls using the Jitsi app

To configure the **Jitsi** video conference on your workspace, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Administration** > **Settings** > **Conference Call**.

3. Enable or disable the call option in DMs, public channels, private channels, and teams as per your needs.

## Initiate calls using the Jitsi app

After successfully installing and configuring the Jitsi app, you can initiate a secure Jitis call inside any Rocket.Chat room by using the slash command `/jitsi` or the call icon in the room header.

Follow the [conference-call-users-guide.md](../conference-call-users-guide.md "mention") to start using it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using mobile apps to join a public server, Jitsi may redirect users to a browser to [complete authentication](https://jitsi.org/blog/authentication-on-meet-jit-si/) before joining calls. Users can choose to stay on the call screen within the app while waiting for another participant to log in, and then they can continue the call via their mobile app. However, if you're using a private Jitsi server, there's no need for anyone to sign in.
