Contact your workspace administrator or follow [conference-call-admin-guide](conference-call-admin-guide/ "mention") to configure conference calls in your workspace.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to effectively participate and use conference calls in your Rocket.Chat after it has been successfully configured.

In Rocket.Chat, you can initiate video and audio conference calls using the configured provider in any [room](../user-guides/rooms/) on your workspace.

## Initiating a call - Direct Message

To start a call in direct message, follow these steps:

* Click on the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/phone-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **call** icon from the room's header. You may have options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. However, these options depend on the conference call provider you have selected.
* Click **Start call**. The pop-up changes to the “calling state” and you have the option to cancel the call. The ringer stays active for 30 seconds. After that, you can choose to **Call again**.

## Incoming direct call

Three things happen once you receive a call:

* A pop-up appears wherever you are in the Rocket.Chat application.
* The incoming call ringer starts to ring.
* An incoming call item will be highlighted in the left sidebar.

The following options are available when you have an incoming call:

* Accept and join the call room.
* Decline and give the other user feedback through the chat.
* Dismiss and ignore the call.

## Start a call - Rooms

You can also start a call in other rooms like teams, channels, discussions, and multiple direct messages.

To start a call in a room, follow these steps:

* Click on the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/phone-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **call** icon from the room's header. You may have options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. However, these options depend on the conference call provider you have selected.
* Click **Start call**. A message is sent in the room, where all participants in the call are shown as thumbnails.
* The call message block allows the following actions: **Reply in Thread**, **Follow Message**, **React**, **Pin**, **Star**, **Copy Link**, and **Delete**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ringing feature is unavailable in any room except **Direct Messages (DMs**).
{% endhint %}

## Conference logs

After a conference call is ended, the room keeps a record of the following:

* The user who initiated it.
* The start time.
* The name of the conference.
* The attendees.
