# Permissions

Rocket.Chat provides a comprehensive and customizable permissions framework. Most user actions require specific permissions, enabling you to tailor user capabilities and visibility within the system.

To access this menu,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions**

{% hint style="success" %}
Permission changes are immediate and transparent. There is no need for users to log out, sign back in, or refresh the system for the revised permissions to take effect.
{% endhint %}

## Roles

A role refers to a set of permissions and privileges assigned to a user or a group of users within the workspace. They determine what actions and features a user can access and control within the Rocket.Chat environment. They are shown as little tags on the side of a username on messages. Rocket.Chat comes with a set of default roles that can be modified.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
See [roles-in-rocket.chat.md](../../../setup-and-configure/roles-in-rocket.chat.md "mention") to learn more about roles.
{% endhint %}

### Scope of Roles

Rocket.Chat provides a comprehensive role-based permission system, which includes two distinct scopes: the Global Scope and the Room Scope. These scopes serve different purposes and offer various permissions that users can assign.

#### Global Scope

A Global Scope Role applies to the entire workspace; _for example —`admin`_. They can be assigned permissions relevant at the server level and not specific to individual [rooms](../rooms.md) or [channels](../../user-guides/rooms/channels/). For example, **Create a Team** is a permission that is applicable server-wide, enabling users to create teams regardless of the room or channel they are currently in.

#### Room Scope

Room scope roles are designed to provide users with specific permissions within individual [rooms](../rooms.md), _for example - `Moderator`_. Room scope permissions are helpful when managing room-specific activities and interactions. For example, you can assign the **Edit Room** permission to a **Moderator** role. However, a user must be set as a moderator in a room before they can edit that room information.

{% hint style="info" %}
While you can globally assign some room roles to a user when creating or editing the user, it would only make meaning once the role is assigned to that user in the specific room.
{% endhint %}

### Creating Custom Roles

As a workspace administrator, you can create new roles with custom permissions for your workspace.

{% hint style="info" %}
From Rocket.Chat `6.0.x` and above, creating and editing roles is only available on the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Premium.svg) [plans](../../../readme/our-plans.md).
{% endhint %}

To create a new role,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions**
* Click on **New role**
* A side panel opens, provide the details required
  * **Role**: Name of the role.
  * **Description**: Set a description of the role.
  * **Scope**: Select what [scope](./#scope-of-roles) the role is to take effect on.
* **Save**

You can now allocate [permissions](./#permissions-available) to the role by checking the checkbox corresponding to each permission beneath the role.

### Default Roles

* **admin** `(Users)` - Have access to all settings and administrator tools.
* **moderator** `(Subscriptions)` - Have moderation permissions for a channel. It has to be elected by a channel owner.
* **owner** `(Subscriptions)` - Have owner permissions for a channel. Users who create a channel become the owner of that channel. They can also elect more owners for that channel.
* **user** `(Users)` - Normal user rights. Most users receive this role when registering.
* **bot** `(Users)` - Special Role for bot users, with some permissions related to bot functionality.
* **leader** `(Subscriptions)` - it doesn't have any special permissions but is used when setting a `leader` to a channel. Leaders appear on the header of a channel.
* **anonymous** `(Users)` - unauthenticated users that access the server when the `Allow Anonymous Read` setting is activated.
* **guest** `(Users)` - anonymous users that want to write and participate in channels when the `Allow Anonymous Read` and `Allow Anonymous Write` settings are activated.
* **livechat-agent** `(Users)` - Agents of Live Chat. They can answer to Live Chat requests.
* **livechat-manager** `(Users)` - Manager of Live Chat, can manage agents and guests.
* **livechat-guest** `(Users)` - Users coming from a Live Chat channel.
