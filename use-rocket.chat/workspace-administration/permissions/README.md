# Permissions

Permissions play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of your workspace, ensuring that users have the right level of access to various functionalities and resources. Rocket.Chat provides a comprehensive permission-based framework for managing access to various features within your workspace.&#x20;

The permissions are assigned to roles. Users with the roles will have access to the permissions. Workspace administrators and users with the permissions can modify the roles and related permissions. To learn about roles in detail, see [Roles in Rocket.Chat](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/roles-in-rocket.chat).

To access the **Permissions** menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions**.
