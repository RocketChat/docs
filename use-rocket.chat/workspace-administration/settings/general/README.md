{% hint style="warning" %}
_Force SSL_ should never be used with reverse proxy. If you have a reverse proxy, you should do the redirect there. This option exists for deployments like Heroku, which does not allow the redirect configuration at the reverse proxy.

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting this to false makes your workspace only accept requests from the same domain of the said workspace. E.g. Rocket.Chat workspace will only accept requests from the Rocket.Chat domain.
{% endhint %}

* **CORS Origin**: Here, you can set what origins are allowed to make requests to your workspace. You can use `*` to accept from all origins. For multiple Origins, use a comma-separated list. E.g `https://domain1.com, https://domain2.com, https://domain3.com`
* **Use REST instead of WebSocket for Meteor calls**: Set if Rest is used instead of WebSocket for Meteor calls.

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Reporting

* **Send Statistics to Rocket.Chat:** By sending your statistics, you'll help us identify how many instances of Rocket.Chat are deployed, as well as how good the system is behaving, so we can further improve it. Don't worry, as no user information is sent and all the information we receive is kept confidential.

```json

 "en": {
  "Channels": "Rooms"
 },
 "pt": {
  "Channels": "Salas"
 }
}
```

## UTF8

* **UTF8 Names Validation**: RegExp used to validate usernames and channel names
* **UTF8 Channel Names Validation**: RegExp used to validate channel names
* **UTF8 Names Slugify:** RegExp used to create slugs for names.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are having problems with names when creating channels (e.g., when using non-English characters), changing these values will probably fix it. For example, using `[\w_-]+` should allow any non-space character to be part of a name.
