# Premium

In certain scenarios, you may need to update your workspace license manually. If your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud, you don't need to update the license here manually. You can sync your license updates automatically in [subscription.md](../subscription.md "mention").

Navigate to **`Administration > Workspace > Settings > Premium`** to access the license update settings.

* **Premium License**: Enter your workspace's license key here.
* **Status**: Displays the current status of your license, indicating whether it is valid or not.
* **Saving Changes**: After making any modifications, ensure to click the 'Save changes' button to apply them.

{% hint style="info" %}
Kindly [contact sales](https://www.rocket.chat/sales-contact) to get a valid license for the [plan](../../../readme/our-plans.md) you want to apply to your workspace. See [trials](../../../setup-and-configure/trials/ "mention") to get a trial period.
