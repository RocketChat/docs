## Configure Outlook calendar

To access the **Outlook calendar** on your workspace,

1. Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Outlook Calendar**.
2. Select **Enable** to enable the integration.

   1.  **Exchange URL:** The exchange server URL you need to access the server. For example, `https://owa.xyz.rocket.cat/`. You can find this value from your browser:\

   2.  **Outlook URL:** The Outlook application URL in the exchange server is used to redirect the user to the correct application. For example, `https://owa.xyz.rocket.cat/owa/#path=/calendar/view/Month`. You can find this value from your browser by going to the Outlook **Calendar** page:\

   3. **Meeting url Regular Expression:** The expression used to detect meeting URLs in event descriptions. The first matching group with a valid URL will be used. HTML-encoded URLs will be decoded automatically.\
      \
      For example, the meeting URL is\
      `https://go.rocket.chat/conference?host=app.video.valtori.fi&path=conference%2Ftest_room%3FcallUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmeet.video.valtori.fi%252Fwebapp%252Fm%252Ftest_room%26callProvider%3DPexip`\
      \
      By default, the regular expression is `(?:[?&]callUrl=([^&<]+))|(?:(?:%3F)|(?:%26))callUrl(?:%3D)((?:(?:^&<))+[^&<]?)`\
      This will match everything that comes after `callURL=` and return the specific URL for the meeting.\

4. Click **Save changes**.
5. To access the Outlook calendar in a room, click the kebab menu at the room header. Select **Outlook calendar.** A sidebar is displayed.
   1. From the Outlook sidebar, click **Login**.

   3. Now, all your events for the current date are fetched and synced to your workspace. Click an event to see more details about it. If the event has a conference call, click the **Join** button beside it to join the call.
