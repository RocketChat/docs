# Workspace Administration

{% hint style="info" %}
As of December 15, 2023, Rocket.Chat has ceased support for connections from cloud services and official mobile/desktop apps to workspaces running legacy versions outside our support window. Users on unsupported legacy servers are advised to upgrade to the latest Rocket.Chat version to ensure continued access to cloud, mobile, and desktop applications. **Each Rocket.Chat version is supported for six months post-release.**
{% endhint %}

This guide is for workspace administrators who administer and manage a Rocket.Chat workspace. They must have an `administrator` role in the workspace.

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace**

This menu is only accessible to users who have been assigned the Administrator role.
