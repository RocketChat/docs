# Users

Now you have your Rocket.Chat workspace is up and running and maybe have some users or none. Visit this menu to view, create, edit, delete, activate, and perform other actions regarding user accounts on your server.

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Users**.

## Invite users to your Rocket.Chat workspace

To access this menu:

* Navigation to **Administration > Workspace > Users**
* Click **Invite** on the top right
* Enter the email of the invitees
* Hit **Send**, and they’ll receive it in their email.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that for self-managed workspaces, you need to have [SMTP enabled](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/email/setup) to be able to send emails through the workspace. If you wish not to do so, you can still [invite users by creating their credentials](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/admin-panel/users/add-new-users).
{% endhint %}

## Add new users

To add(create) new users:

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Users**
* Click **New** on the top right
* Enter user credentials
* Hit **Save**

{% hint style="info" %}
The settings **Set random password and send by email** and **Send welcome email** will require [SMTP enabled](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/settings/email/setup#set-up-your-credentials) to send emails successfully.
{% endhint %}
