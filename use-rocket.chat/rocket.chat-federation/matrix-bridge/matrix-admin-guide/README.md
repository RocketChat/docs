# Matrix Admin Guide

To enable federation on your workspace, as a workspace [administrator](../../../workspace-administration/), you need to set up Matrix protocol for federated communication.

* [**Matrix Homeserver Setup**](deploy-a-federated-rocket.chat-workspace.md): Setup a Matrix Homeserver following the [automated](deploy-a-federated-rocket.chat-workspace.md#automated-installation) or [manual](deploy-a-federated-rocket.chat-workspace.md#manual-installation) guide.
* [**Matrix Bridge Configuration**](matrix-bridge-configuration.md): Configure the Matrix protocol settings for your workspace after manual installation.
* [**Matrix Allow/Block List**](federation-access-control.md): See how to create a list of allowed and blocked IP addresses from communicating with your workspace.
