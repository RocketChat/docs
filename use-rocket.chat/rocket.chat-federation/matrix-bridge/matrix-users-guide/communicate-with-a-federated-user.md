# Communicate with a federated user

After you have configured everything and created some federated channels, you're now able to:

* Send and receive messages.
* Send and receive messages with emojis.
* Send and receive messages using the whole [Markdown Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/).
* Send and receive attachments (Files, audio, and video).
* Send and receive message threads.
* Quote messages.
* React to messages.
* Edit Messages.
* Delete Messages (only your messages).
* Mention internal and external users inside any federated room.
* Send and receive users' [typing indicator](../matrix-admin-guide/matrix-homeserver-setup/#important-warning-about-the-installation).
* [Assign user roles](assign-roles-for-users-in-federated-rooms.md) within the room context.

There are also some features not directly related to rooms:

* Users' avatar synchronization.
* Servers'[ allow list/block list](../matrix-admin-guide/matrix-homeserver-setup/matrix-allow-block-list.md).
