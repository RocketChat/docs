# Federation Admin Guide

Rocket.Chat Federation utilizes the [Matrix Federation Protocol (MFP)](https://matrix.org/) to connect servers, enabling seamless communication with users on Matrix-compatible platforms like [Element](https://element.io/).  Matrix bridges allow users to connect with other networks, enabling interaction across different platforms. For instance, Element users can communicate with Slack, Discord, or Rocket.Chat users through bridges. Kindly refer to the [official documentation](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/elements-of-matrix/#appservice-bridges-and-some-bots) for more details.
