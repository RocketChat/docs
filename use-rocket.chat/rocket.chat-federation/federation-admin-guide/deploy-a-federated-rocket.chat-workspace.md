# Deploy a Federated Rocket.Chat Workspace

To configure a Matrix bridge that allows Rocket.Chat users to engage in federated rooms and communicate with federated users, a homeserver is required. [Homeservers](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/elements-of-matrix/#homeserver) are key components that host user accounts and other data related to communication. It also facilitates communication between users on different servers by relaying messages through a network of matrix servers until they reach the destination. Rocket.Chat listens to events happening in the homeserver and sends events relayed to other networks. For further details, explore the [Rocket.Chat and Matrix architecture](https://github.com/RocketChat/federation-docs/blob/cdd9c3823e4f4329c87402640543226f8423fbd1/DESIGN.md).

This documentation details the deployment of a Federated Rocket.Chat workspace with Kubernetes using Helm.  You have the option to deploy it either as a monolithic setup or as microservices.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you proceed, kindly consult the official guide for[ deploying a basic Rocket.Chat workspace on Kubernetes using Helm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6FmYzIiK959Nyq-PQLzbR9v8yKiuP9OryUZGOwhrNw/edit?usp=sharing) to gain a foundational understanding of the Kubernetes procedure.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster up and running
* Helm must be installed
* Your firewall rules must allow HTTPS traffic
* The following Kubernetes resources must be deployed on your server:
  * [Storage Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
  * [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers)&#x20;
  * Certificate controller&#x20;
  * ClusterIssuer
  * [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
  * [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#persistentvolumeclaim)
* You require two domains. For example,
  * _domain.xyz_ - The URL for your Rocket.Chat workspace
  * _synapse.domain.xyz_ - The URL for your Synapse server

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that the domains are pointing to your server IP.
{% endhint %}

Once you've confirmed that all prerequisites are met, continue with the following steps to deploy a federated Rocket.Chat workspace using Kubernetes.

1. **Define the deployment configurations**

To deploy a federated Rocket.Chat workspace with the [official Rocket.Chat helm chart](https://github.com/RocketChat/helm-charts/tree/master/rocketchat), define the configuration options for your deployment in a _values.yaml_ file.

**For a monolithic deployment, create a **_**values.yaml**_** with the following contents:**

```yaml
image:
 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 repository: registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat
 tag: <release> #Replace it with your target release


mongodb:
 enabled: true  #For test purposes, a single mongodb pod is deployed, consider an external MongoDB cluster for production environments
 auth:
   passwords:
     - rocketchat
   rootPassword: rocketchatroot


microservices:
 enabled: false  #This must be set to false
host: domain.xyz  #This is the domain for your Rocket.Chat server, Replace it with your own domain
ingress:
 enabled: true
 ingressClassName: nginx  # State the ingress controller that is installed in the K8s cluster
 annotations:
   cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: production-cert-issuer # Replace with the name of your ClusterIssuer
 tls:
   - secretName: federation #This is the name of the secret - You can use a different name if needed
     hosts:
       - domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Rocket.Chat server, Replace it with your own domain 
       - synapse.domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Synapse server, Replace it with your own domain 

federation:
 enabled: true
 host: synapse.domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Synapse server, Replace it with your own domain 
 persistence:
   enabled: true
   existingClaim: synapse-helm #Replace with the name of your persistent volume claim

postgresql:
 enabled: true 
```

**For a microservices deployment, create a **_**values.yaml**_** with the following contents:**

```yaml
image:
 pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 repository: registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat
 tag: 6.6.6 #Replace it by your target release
 replicaCount: 1 #Number of replicas/pods for Rocket.Chat


mongodb:
 enabled: true  #For test purposes, a single mongodb pod is deployed, consider an external MongoDB cluster for production environments
 auth:
   passwords:
     - rocketchat
   rootPassword: rocketchatroot

microservices:
  enabled: true
  presence:
    replicas: 1
  ddpStreamer:
    replicas: 1
  account:
    replicas: 1
  authorization:
    replicas: 1
  streamHub:
    replicas: 1
  nats:
    replicas: 1

host: domain.xyz  This is the domain for your Rocket.Chat server, Replace it with your own domain 
ingress:
 enabled: true
 ingressClassName: nginx  #State the ingress controller that is installed in the K8s cluster 
 annotations:
   cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: production-cert-issuer #Replace with the name of your ClusterIssuer
 tls:
   - secretName: federation #This is the name of the secret - You can use a different name if needed
     hosts:
       - domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Rocket.Chat server, Replace it with your own domain 
       - synapse.domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Synapse server, Replace it with your own domain 
federation:
 enabled: true
 host: synapse.domain.xyz #This is the domain for your Rocket.Chat server, Replace it with your own domain
 persistence:
   enabled: true
   existingClaim: synapse-helm #Replace with the name of your persistent volume claim

postgresql:
 enabled: true
```

* Replace the `<release`> with the [Rocket.Chat release](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) tag you want to deploy.
* Update _domain.xyz_ with your domain name
* Optionally, you can use a different `secretName` for `tls`.
* Ensure that the appropriate `ingressclassName`,  `existingClaim`, and cluster issuer are specified.
* You can also update the replicas for your microservices deployment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Kindly refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/deploy-rocket.chat/additional-deployment-methods/deploy-with-kubernetes#define-the-configurations-in-a-file) to learn more about the various configurations you can set for Helm in Rocket.Chat. To use microservices, visit our [Microservices documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/deploy-rocket.chat/scaling-rocket.chat/microservices) for more details.
{% endhint %}

2. **Install Rocket.Chat & Synapse**

* Add the Rocket.Chat[ helm chart repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/helm-charts/tree/master/rocketchat) by running the following command:

```
helm repo add rocketchat https://rocketchat.github.io/helm-charts
```

If successful, it returns a response that "rocketchat" has been added to your repositories.

* Install Rocket.Chat with the following command:

```
helm install rocketchat -f values.yaml rocketchat/rocketchat
```

If your deployment is successful, youâ€™ll get a response similar to the following:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/successful-federation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Verify that the corresponding certificates, secrets, and pods have been successfully created with the `kubectl get pods` command.

**For a monolithic deployment**, the response is similar to the image below, depending on your configurations:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/monolithic-federation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**For a microservices deployment**, the response is similar to the image below, depending on your configurations:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/federation-microservices.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can now access your workspace via the URL where Rocket.Chat was deployed (your domain), and complete the [Setup Wizard](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/accessing-your-workspace/rocket.chat-setup-wizard).&#x20;

3. **Test the federation**

To test the federation, send a[ direct message](../../user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/) to any user on a matrix-compatible server. You can DM a user on another federated Rocket.Chat workspace or Element.

**To send a DM to a user on Element:**

* Create a user account on [Element](https://app.element.io/)
* Create a[ 1:1 Direct Message](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/create-a-new-direct-message) on your Rocket.Chat workspace. Add the [Element](https://app.element.io/) user as a member of the DM using this syntax: `@username:matrix.org`. Then, send a message.
* You receive an invite notification on Element that the user from your Rocket.Chat workspace wants to send a message. Accept the invite and continue the conversation.

**To send a DM to a user on another federated Rocket.Chat workspace:**

* Deploy another federated workspace with the steps highlighted above.
* Create a[ 1:1 Direct Message](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/create-a-new-direct-message) on your Rocket.Chat workspace. Add a user from the second federated workspace as a member of the DM using this syntax: `@username:server`.  For example, `@test_user:your_workspace_domain`.
* Then, send the message to the user.
* The user receives the message and you can continue exchanging conversations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Kindly refer to [create-federated-rooms.md](../federation-user-guide/create-federated-rooms.md "mention") to learn more about sending messages to federated users.
{% endhint %}

Now that your federated workspace is ready, you can:

* Go to the[ Matrix User's Guide](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/federation/matrix-bridge/matrix-users-guide) to learn how to invite external users on the Matrix protocol to your workspace, join channels on the Matrix network, etc.
* [Allow or block](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/federation/matrix-bridge/matrix-admin-guide/matrix-homeserver-setup/matrix-allow-block-list) specific IP addresses to communicate with your workspace.\
