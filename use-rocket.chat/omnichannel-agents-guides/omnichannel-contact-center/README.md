# Omnichannel Contact Center

The Omnichannel Contact Center is a directory of contacts, chats, and calls in your omnichannel workspace. Rocket.Chat provides the contact center to enable workspace administrators, managers, and agents to effectively oversee and manage omnichannel contacts, calls, and chats. This guide will teach you how to manage omnichannel contacts using the **Contact Center**.
