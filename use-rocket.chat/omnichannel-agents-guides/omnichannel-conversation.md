## Place conversation On-Hold ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2021-06-10\_22-31-38 (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (2) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (10) (11).jpg>)

During supporting conversation as an agent, you can find yourself in a situation where Omnichannel contacts terminate the conversation abruptly. Still, the conversation will persist in your queue until it is **Closed**. This can potentially impact your service capacity as you may be unable to engage in new conversations due to the maximum number of simultaneous conversations allowed per agent. To address this concern, you can pause the conversation temporarily by using the Place Chat On-Hold feature.

To place a conversation on hold,

* Click <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (638).png" alt="" data-size="line">
* Click **Place Chat On-Hold**

If the Omnichannel contact engages again, the routing algorithm will try to find you first to assign this conversation. If you are busy serving other conversations at maximum capacity, the conversation will be assigned to the next available agent.

You can also click the conversation in the queue anytime and click **Resume** to engage with the same contact again.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can manually place the conversation on hold only when you send the last message to the contact.
{% endhint %}

## Closing a conversation

To end a conversation:

* Click <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/end-conversation.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon.
* Enter comments if any
* Update [Tags](../omnichannel/tags.md) for this conversation
* Select **Export chat transcript as PDF** in case you need it exported.
* Select **Send chat transcript via email** if you want it sent to the guest's email.
* Click **Confirm,** and the conversation disappears from the **Chats in Progress** queue.
* The PDF conversation transcript is sent to you as a direct message if you request that the chat be exported.

## Calling
