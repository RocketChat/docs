# SAML

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. With SAML, users can log in once and gain access to multiple web applications. Rocket.Chat supports this standardized user authentication and authorization protocol, enabling organizations to establish secure login processes.&#x20;

This section guides you through the configuration details and examples to show how you can set up your SAML integration.

## Key features of SAML integration

* **Centralized authentication**: Rocket.Chat relies on SAML identity providers to centralize your organization's user information and manage user access to resources in Rocket.Chat
* **Map user data:** Mapping your user data from the SAML identity provider to Rocket.Chat ensures that the relevant user information, such as usernames, roles, and email addresses, is correctly associated with Rocket.Chat.
* **Customization and flexible configuration:** Rocket.Chat provides the settings to customize the login and logout behavior, and the user interface.
* **Premium workspace settings:** Additional settings include advanced user and data sync options for workspaces on any of the premium plans.

The next sub-sections give you the details about the SAML configuration options in Rocket.Chat and some examples of SAML integrations that you can implement. By integrating any of these methods, organizations can ensure industry-standard security and extend their user roles and permissions to their Rocket.Chat workspaces.
