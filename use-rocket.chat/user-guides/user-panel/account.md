2. **Browser Language:** If you haven't selected a language under [user preferences](account.md#preference), Rocket.Chat will use the language configured in your web browser.
3. [**Server Language**](../../workspace-administration/settings/general/#general-settings)**:** This is the default language set by the Rocket.Chat workspace administrator. It's only used as a last resort if neither your user preference nor browser language is available.

## Security

You can update the following account security settings depending on your workspace settings.

### **Password**

This tab is displayed if the setting to change passwords in [Accounts](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/accounts) is enabled.

* Update your **password** and **confirm the new password**.
* Then, click **Save Changes**.

### **Two Factor Authentication**

This tab is displayed if 2FA is enabled in the workspace settings.

Refer to the [two-factor-authentication-user-guide.md](../security-bundle/two-factor-authentication-user-guide.md "mention") to gain a comprehensive understanding of two-factor authentication in Rocket.Chat.

### **E2E Encryption**

This tab is displayed if [E2E encryption](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/e2e-encryption) is enabled in the workspace settings.

You can create encrypted private groups and direct messages. You may also update existing private groups or DMs to encrypted. It is end-to-end encryption, so the key to encode/decode your messages isn't saved on the server. For that reason, you need to store your password somewhere safe. You are required to enter it on other devices you wish to use E2E encryption.

**Change Encryption Password**

To create an encryption password,

* Enter a new encryption password&#x20;
* Confirm the new encryption password and click **Save Changes**

#### &#x20;**Reset E2E Key**

This option will remove your current E2E key and log you out. When you log in again, Rocket.Chat will generate a new key and restore your access to any encrypted room that has one or more members online. Due to the nature of the E2E encryption, Rocket.Chat can't restore access to any encrypted room with no members online.

{% hint style="info" %}
Refer to the [E2E Encryption user guide ](../security-bundle/end-to-end-encryption-user-guide.md)for more details.
{% endhint %}
