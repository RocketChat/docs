## Security

You can enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account to enhance your account security. There are two options for 2FA in Rocket.Chat :&#x20;

* **Two-factor authentication via TOTP :** It requires a key code from an authenticator app.
* **Two-factor authentication via Email :** It requies a key code that was sent to your email address**.**&#x20;

To access security settings,&#x20;

* Navigate to **Avatar Menu > Account** > **Security**.

To enable **Two-factor authentication via TOTP**,

* Click **Enable Two-factor authentication via TOTP**.
* Use an authentication app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo, to scan the QR code. Scanning the QR code displays a six-digit code. Enter the code into Rocket.Chat.
* Copy your backup code somewhere safe if you need to access it in the future without the authentication app. Click **Send** to finish.

To disable the 2FA, click **Disable Two-factor authentication via TOTP**.

To enable **Two-factor authentication via Email**,

* Click **Enable Two-factor authentication via Email**.

To disable the 2FA, click **Disable Two-factor authentication via Email**.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;If you can't find the 2FA setting, please contact your workspace administrator. [See a detailed guide on 2FA here](account.md#two-factor-authentication).
{% endhint %}

### E2E Encryption

You can now create encrypted private groups and direct messages. You may also update existing private groups or DMs to encrypted. It is end-to-end encryption, so the key to encode/decode your messages isn't saved on the server. For that reason, you need to store your password somewhere safe. You will be required to enter it on other devices you wish to use e2e encryption.

#### **Change Encryption Password**

To create an encryption password,

* Enter a new encryption password&#x20;
* Confirm new encryption password and click **Save Changes**

#### &#x20;**Reset E2E Key**

This option will remove your current E2E key and log you out. When you log in again, Rocket.Chat will generate a new key and restore your access to any encrypted room that has one or more members online. Due to the nature of the E2E encryption, Rocket.Chat can't restore access to any encrypted room with no members online.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Please find a detailed guide on E2E Encryption here.](../security-bundle/end-to-end-encryption-user-guide.md)
{% endhint %}

## Personal Access Tokens

You can create personalized access tokens to use when making API calls.

To access **Personal Access Tokens**,&#x20;
