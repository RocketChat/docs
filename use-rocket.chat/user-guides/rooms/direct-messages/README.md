# Direct Messages

In Rocket.Chat, you can have one-on-one conversations or one-to-many conversations with users in your workspace. They are called **Direct Messages(DMs).** Your most recent DMs are default listed under the **Direct Messages** section in your Rocket.Chat sidebar.  They are identified by ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/direct-message icon.png>).

## Types Of Direct Messages

There are two types of DMs named **1:1 Direct Message** and **1:M Direct Message**.

**Direct messages (DMs)** are private one-on-one conversations between members of your workspace. You can create a direct message(DM) with another user on the same workspace (or a different workspace, thanks to Rocket.Chat [Federation](broken-reference)) to communicate and share files privately. It exists between just two users, and no other user can join.

**Direct Messages Between Multiple Users** allows you to chat with multiple users inside a DM. You can create direct message rooms between several users to exchange messages and files. Unlike [private channels](../channels/#private-channels), you do not need to specify the name, topic, or if the room is read-only. It works exactly like a 1:1 DM, the only difference is that multiple users are involved.
