Rocket.Chat offers some additional team functionalities for workspaces subscribed to any of the [premium plans](../../../workspace-administration/settings/premium.md). They include the following:

#### AD / LDAP Sync

Connecting Rocket.Chat with tools like Active Directory Groups or Keycloak makes team management easier for IT teams. This feature ensures that any changes you make to your organization's infrastructure or user details are instantly reflected in Rocket.Chat. It's especially handy for larger teams, where you're frequently adding or removing members. Essentially, it keeps Rocket.Chat in sync with your company's structure automatically, saving you time and effort in managing teams. Workspaces subscribed to any of Rocket.Chat's [premium plans](../../../workspace-administration/settings/premium.md) can access the **Auto-Join** and **Auto-Leave** Teams feature in [LDAP](../../../authentication/ldap/ldap-premium-settings.md#h8eyqbx7wnb).
