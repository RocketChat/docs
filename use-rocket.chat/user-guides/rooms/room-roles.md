# Room Roles

Rocket.Chat rooms have different roles that users can assign to control actions and features within a particular [room](./), including [Teams](teams/), [Channels](channels/), and [Discussions](discussions/). These roles are associated with permissions in the [room scope](../../workspace-administration/permissions/#scope-of-roles).

### Available Room Roles

By default, there are three major room roles available in a Rocket.Chat workspace:

* **Owner**: This is the highest room-scoped role. It provides complete control over the room, including the ability to change its name and description, manage its members, and delete the room entirely.
* **Leader**: A Room leader has significant control over the room and can manage room members, edit the room name and description, and perform other tasks pertaining to the room.
* **Moderator**: This role is designed to help keep the room organized and on-topic. Moderators can delete messages, kick users out, and pin important messages to the top of the room.

Creating custom roles is exclusively available to workspaces subscribed to the [Enterprise plan](../../../readme/our-plans.md#enterprise-plan).  For more details, kindly visit [#creating-custom-roles](../../workspace-administration/permissions/#creating-custom-roles "mention").
