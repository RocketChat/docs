## Join a Channel

You can join a channel through a search, invites, or mentions. Use the search box in the menu bar to search for channels and users. Alternatively, you can use `Ctrl/Cmd + k` to access the search bar quickly.&#x20;

Users and channels are displayed in the search results. However, private channels are not displayed. If you select a public channel that you are not a member of, click the **Join** button to join that channel.

## Mark Channel as Favorite

To help organize and prioritize your communications, you can **favorite** (or **star**) channels, private groups, and DMs. All channels marked as favorites are listed at the top of the sidebar so that it is easy to access.

To mark a **channel** as a favorite,

* At the top of the channel page, click the **star** icon next to the channel name to mark a channel as **Favorite**.
* To remove the channel from **Favorites,** click the **star** icon again.
