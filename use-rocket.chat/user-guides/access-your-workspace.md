## Registering an account

There are two ways to register as a user on your Rocket.Chat workspace:

1. **Manual Registration:** Provide your name, email, username password, and confirm password. Some workspaces may require email verification.\
   The registration credentials may vary based on the workspace configurations. Kindly contact your workspace administrator if you're unsure of how to register your account.&#x20;
2. **OAuth Registration:** If your workspace has enabled [OAuth services](../authentication/oauth/) (such as GitHub or Google), you can use your account from those supported services to register and access the workspace. Once you have completed a successful registration,  proceed to select a unique username.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your username serves as a unique identifier for others to direct message or mention you within the workspace. It differs from your display name and must be unique within the workspace, while display names can be duplicated.
