As a Livechat Manager, you can set tags to be assigned to the Livechat conversations by the agents. Tags can be used to sort Livechat conversations easily. **Omnichannel Tags** are used for marking and classifying Omnichannel conversations.

{% hint style="info" %}
A practical use case is using tags to mark the progress made on a Livechat query. You can have tags like `new`, `blocked`, `in progress,` `completed` etc.
{% endhint %}

To access **Tags** settings, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Tags**.

## List Omnichannel tags

On the **Tags** page, you see a list of tags if they exist. Clicking on one opens up a page where it can be edited.

## Create Omnichannel tags

To create a new tag:

* Click **Create tag**.
* Enter the following information:
  * **Name**: Enter the name you wish for the Tag
  * **Description**: A description of what the Tag is
  * **Departments**: Select a list of departments in which the tag is available. Leave it empty to make it available for all departments.

When created, Omnichannel agents can use the tag on conversations.

## Delete Omnichannel tags

To delete an existing **Tag**,

* Click on the **Delete** icon across the **Tag** from the main settings screen.
