# Real-time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring allows you to monitor your incoming and ongoing Livechat conversations in real-time.

To access the Omnichannel real-time monitoring dashboard, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Real-time Monitoring**. These monitoring metrics can be filtered by the **department** and set to be updated in a specified amount of time by changing the **Update every** field.

When a Livechat conversation is initiated, it is reflected immediately on the monitoring dashboard in real-time.
