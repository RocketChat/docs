<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Premium.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Reports** offer a robust tool tailored for workspace administrators and managers to effectively monitor and assess customer service metrics across various categories and specific time intervals. They grant an in-depth view into conversation data and the performance of agents within your workspace.&#x20;

You can use filters to select time ranges like **Today**, **This Week**, **Last 15 days**, **This Month,** **Last 6 Months,** and **Last year**. You can also export the data to a **CSV** file. By selecting specific time ranges on the Reports dashboard, you can easily identify patterns and trends that were previously difficult to discern among random data points.

To access the **Omnichannel Reports** dashboard,

* Go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Reports.**&#x20;
* It displays different categories of omnichannel reports based on **Status**, **Channels**, **Departments**, **Tags,** and **Agents**.
