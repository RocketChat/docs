Using Omnichannel units, you can group a set of departments for management purposes. As an [Omnichannel manager](managers.md), you can make a unit of multiple [departments](departments.md) and assign a monitor to oversee them.

To access **Units** settings, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Units**.

## List Omnichannel Units

On the **Units** page, you see a list of all the existing units and a button to initiate the creation of a new unit. Clicking on an existing unit opens up a page where you can edit it.

## Create Omnichannel Unit

To create a new unit,

* Click **Create unit**.
* Enter the following information:
  * **Name:** The name of the new unit.

  * **Departments**: Add the desired departments to your unit.
  * **Monitors**: Assign users who will be monitors to the unit.
* Click **Save**.
