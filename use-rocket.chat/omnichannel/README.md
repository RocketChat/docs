# Omnichannel

{% hint style="info" %}
Effective December 6, 2023, Rocket.Chat will cease support for connections from cloud services and official mobile/desktop apps to workspaces running legacy versions outside our support window. Users on unsupported legacy servers are advised to upgrade to the latest Rocket.Chat version to ensure continued access to cloud, mobile, and desktop applications. **Each Rocket.Chat version is supported for six months post-release.**
{% endhint %}

Rocket.Chat **Omnichannel** facilitates the integration of multiple customer communication channels into your workspace. This feature includes the integration of an [Omnichannel Live Chat widget ](livechat-widget-installation.md)on your website, acting as a gateway for customer interactions or direct support. Additionally, it offers  [Omnichannel Apps](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/), enabling seamless interactions between Rocket.Chat and external users across various platforms such as [WhatsApp](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/whatsapp/), [SMS](../workspace-administration/settings/sms.md), [Facebook](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/facebook-app/), [Instagram Direct](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/instagram-direct/), [Telegram](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/telegram-app/), and more. The use of Omnichannel is instrumental in attracting and retaining customers in a multi-channel environment, thereby safeguarding potential sales opportunities and fostering relationships. It ensures an outstanding experience by enabling interactions across diverse communication channels. The primary users of Rocket.Chat Omnichannel are [Admins](./), [Managers](managers.md), and [Agents](agents.md).
