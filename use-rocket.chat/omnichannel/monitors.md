Monitors in Omnichannel are users that have the ability to monitor Omnichannel activities and have access to [Current Chats](current-chats.md), [Analytics](analytics.md), [Real-time Monitoring](real-time-monitoring.md), [Agents](agents.md), [Departments](departments.md), [Business Hours](business-hours.md) and [Canned Responses](canned-responses/).

{% hint style="info" %}
A monitor is only able to view analytics or activities of a department if they are assigned to a [unit](units.md).
{% endhint %}

To access Omnichannel Monitors, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Monitors**.

## List Omnichannel Monitors

## Delete Omnichannel Monitor

To delete an Omnichannel Monitor,

* Click the **Delete** icon on the right across the user. This will remove the `livechat-monitor` role from that user.
