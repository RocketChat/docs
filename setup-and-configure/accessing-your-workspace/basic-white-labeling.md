# Basic White-labeling

A standout feature of Rocket.Chat is its white-labeling capability, which allows you to tailor your workspace to reflect your organization's brand identity. This enhances the user experience and reinforces your brand identity among your team members. However, you must have [admin](../roles-in-rocket.chat.md) role privileges to leverage these white-labeling capabilities.

### Additional Branding Elements

**Rocket.Chat Logo**

The Rocket.Chat logo appears on the sidebar footer for workspaces subscribed to any of our [plans](../../readme/our-plans.md), and it can be customized.

**Rocket.Chat Watermark**

The Rocket.Chat watermark appears on the sidebar footer for workspaces on [**Community**](../../readme/our-plans.md#community), [**Starter**](../../readme/our-plans.md#starter-plan), [**Pro Trial**](../trials/pro-trial.md), or [**Enterprise Trial**](../trials/enterprise-trial.md) plans, and cannot be customized or removed. Workspaces with active [**Pro** ](../../readme/our-plans.md#pro-plan)or [**Enterprise**](../../readme/our-plans.md#enterprise-plan) subscriptions do not display this watermark.
