# Inviting Users

Building a collaborative workspace is not just about creating a platform, but also about bringing together the right people. After setting up your [Rocket.Chat workspace](rocket.chat-setup-wizard.md) and customizing it to reflect your brand's identity through [white-labeling](basic-white-labeling.md), the next crucial step is to [invite users ](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/)to join your workspace. This process is straightforward and can be done by the [admin user.](admin-account-creation.md) However, for self-managed workplaces, it's important to note that the SMTP must be enabled and configured before emails can be sent through the workspace.

{% content-ref url="../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/" %}
[users](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For self-managed workplaces, [SMTP must be enabled and configured](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/email/email-configuration.md) before emails can be sent through the workspace.
{% endhint %}

By following these steps, you can create a collaborative environment that not only reflects your brand's identity but also facilitates effective communication and collaboration among your team members.
