# Rocket.Chat Setup Wizard

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring your Rocket.Chat workspace using the **Setup Wizard.** By the end of this guide, you'll be well-equipped to create, access, and manage your workspace effectively.

After [deploying your workspace](../../deploy/deploy-rocket.chat/), [access your workspace](./) and follow these steps:&#x20;

*   **Admin Information**: The first user to access the workspace is recognized as the workspace administrator. Fill in the required user information to create the admin account.

    * **Full name**: Set the first and last name.
    * **Username**: Specify the admin username.
    * **Email**: Enter your email.
    * **Password**: Create a password for the admin user.

    Click **Next** to continue.
*   **Organization Information**: This involves information about your organization. Update the following required information about your organization:

    * **Organization name**: Your organization name.
    * **Organization industry**: The industry your organization operates under.
    * **Organization size**: The size of the organization
    * **Country**: The country in which your organization is.

    Click **Continue** to proceed to the third step.
* **Register Your Workspace**:  Add an admin email to register your workspace to [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) or link the workspace to an existing [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) account.
  * Agree to the [**Terms**](../../legal-and-compliance/rocket.chat-terms/terms-of-service/) and [**Privacy Policy**](broken-reference)&#x20;
  * Click **Register** to proceed to the last step.
* An email with a confirmation link is sent to the admin email you provided. Open the email and click **Verify Registration** to ensure the security codes match.

Once you've completed these steps, your workspace will be set up and ready to use. You can access it by logging in with your admin credentials. You can always update these setup information in **Workspace Administration** [setup-wizard.md](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/setup-wizard.md "mention").
