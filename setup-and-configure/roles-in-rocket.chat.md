# Roles in Rocket.Chat

Roles and permissions are integral to managing access in any digital workspace. Rocket.Chat's comprehensive role-based system allows administrators to assign roles, each with a specific set of [permissions](../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/permissions/), to control user actions and access levels within the workspace.

A role refers to a set of permissions and privileges assigned to a user or a group of users within the workspace. The roles determine the controls and features a user can access or handle in a workspace. They are displayed as mini tags beside the username on messages.

You can view the roles from **Administration** > **Permissions**. The **Name** row displays the roles. The permissions that each role has are displayed in the table. You can edit the permissions and roles as per your needs.

This topic guides you through the categories of roles available in Rocket.Chat and the scope within which the roles can be applied to users.

## Categories of Rocket.Chat Roles

The following categories of roles are available in Rocket.Chat:

### **Rocket.Chat Administrator Role**

A Rocket.Chat administrator has the `admin` role, which gives full access to the entire Rocket.Chat workspace. They can manage both [workspace-administration](../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/ "mention") and [omnichannel](../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/ "mention") settings.

### **Rocket.Chat User Roles**

Rocket.Chat users can have one or more roles, allowing them to perform the various actions granted by the role's permissions.

<table><thead><tr><th width="253">Role</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>user</code></td><td>The user role is the most common in Rocket.Chat.

### Rocket.Chat Omnichannel Roles

### Rocket.Chat Marketplace Roles

Internally, there are two roles for [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/). The first is within the publisher, and the second is within the workspace. Henceforth, they're known as publisher roles and system roles.

#### Publisher Roles

There are three different roles within a Publisher, which include the following:

* **Owner**
* **Developer**
* **Viewer**

The **Owner** role is applied whenever someone creates a publisher. Each of the subsequent roles only applies to people they have invited.

<table><thead><tr><th width="266">Role</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Publisher: Owner</code></td><td><p>The <code>owner</code> has the permission to manage everything on the publisher dashboard. It includes managing both apps and other users. </p><p></p><p>To change the role of another user:</p><ul><li>Click <strong>Change Role</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown across the user in question.</li><li>Select the desired role to change.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><code>Publisher: Developer</code></td><td>A user with the <code>developer</code> role can read everything and update apps.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Publisher: Viewer</code></td><td>The <code>viewer</code> role can read everything but can't update anything.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Scope of Rocket.Chat roles

The user and omnichannel roles are also categorized into **Global** and **Room** scopes.

### **Global Scope**

Global roles are designed to provide users with permissions that apply to the entire workspace; for example â€” `admin`. They can be assigned permissions relevant at the server level and not specific to individual [rooms](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms) or [channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/channels). For example, **Create a Team** is a permission that is applicable server-wide, enabling users to create teams regardless of the room or channel they are currently in.

### **Room Scope**

Room scope roles are designed to provide users with specific permissions within individual [rooms](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms), for example - `Moderator`. Room scope permissions are helpful when managing room-specific activities and interactions. For example, you can assign the **Edit Room** permission to a **Moderator** role. A user must be set as a moderator in a room before they can edit that room information.

{% hint style="info" %}
While you can globally assign some room roles to a user when creating or editing the user, it takes effect once the role is assigned to that user in a specific room.
{% endhint %}

## **Default Roles**

Every Rocket.chat workspace has some default roles, which include the following:

* **admin** (Global scope) - Have access to all settings and workspace administrator tools.
* **moderator** (Room scope) - Have moderation permissions for a channel. It must be assigned by the [room](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms) owner.
* **owner** (Room scope) - Have owner permissions for a room. Users who create a room become the owner of that room. They can also assign more owners for that room.
* **user** (Global scope) - Normal user rights. Most users receive this role when registering in the workspace.
* **bot** (Global scope) - Special Role for bot users, with some permissions related to bot functionality.
* **leader** (Room scope) - It is used when setting a `leader` in a [room](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms). Leaders appear on the header of a channel.
* **anonymous** (Global scope) - Unauthenticated users that access the workspace when the `Allow Anonymous Read` setting is activated.
* **guest** (Global scope) - Anonymous users that want to write and participate in rooms when the `Allow Anonymous Read` and `Allow Anonymous Write` settings are activated.
* **livechat-agent** (Global scope) - Omnichannel [agents](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/agents). They can answer to Live Chat requests.
* **livechat-manager** (Global scope) - Omnichannel [managers](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/managers), can manage agents and guests.
* **livechat-guest** (Global scope) - Users coming from a Live Chat room.

## Edit and delete roles

* Click the role from the **Name** row.
* Update the required details and click **Save** to edit the role**.**
* Click **Delete** to delete the role.

By offering a variety of predefined roles and the ability to create custom roles, Rocket.Chat ensures that workspace administrators can effectively control and limit user actions.
