# Pro Trial

Available from Rocket.Chat version 6.5 or higher, the Pro Plan is tailored for growing organizations seeking advanced features and support to enhance their collaboration capabilities. The plan offers a robust platform with larger user capacity, increased [monthly active contacts](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/monthly-active-contacts-macs.md) compared to [Starter plan](../../readme/our-plans.md#starter-plan), along with a range of premium features. It's an ideal fit for businesses in expansion, balancing advanced functionality with strong support to facilitate effective collaboration.

For workspaces currently on the Starter plan, exceeding certain predefined limits triggers a 30-day Pro trial. The following diagram shows the events that will trigger the Pro trial:

It's important to note that if a workspace initiates an Enterprise trial while on a Pro trial, the Enterprise trial will continue only for the remaining duration of the initial 30-day Pro trial. For example, if an Enterprise trial begins on the 15th day of the Pro trial, it will be available for the subsequent 15 days.
{% endhint %}

If you decide against participating in the trials, you can opt to [Cancel Workspace Subscription](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/license-application#cancel-workspace-subscription) at any time during the trial period and switch back to the [Community](https://docs.rocket.chat/readme/our-plans#community) version.
{% endhint %}

This trial mechanism allows potential users to thoroughly explore the Pro Plan's advanced capabilities, enabling them to make an informed decision about upgrading to the Pro Plan.
