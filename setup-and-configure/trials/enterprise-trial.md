# Enterprise Trial

The Enterprise Plan is designed for large-scale organizations requiring a secure, customizable, and comprehensive communication platform. It provides scalable solutions, sophisticated compliance tools, and prioritized support to meet the intricate demands of major enterprises and sectors with strict regulatory standards. Emphasizing high performance, dependability, and advanced integration capabilities, this plan is an ideal selection for businesses looking for a premier collaboration platform.

If your workspace is on the Pro plan and exceeds some specific limits of the Pro plan, the 30-day Enterprise trial is activated. The following diagram shows the events that will trigger the Enterprise trial:

Keep in mind that if an Enterprise trial is triggered while your workspace is on the Pro trial, the Enterprise trial will only be available for the number of remaining days within your 30-day trial. For example, if an Enterprise trial is triggered on the 15th day of your Pro trial, the Enterprise trial will be available to you for the next 15 days.
