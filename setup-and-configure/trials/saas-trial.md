# SaaS Trial

The cloud-hosted SaaS workspaces are only available for the Pro and Enterprise plans. Rocket.Chat hosts the SaaS trial workspaces to the Rocket.Chat Cloud for 30 days. Note that SaaS trial workspaces are launched with the [Pro trial](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/trials/pro-trial).

To apply for a SaaS trial, go to [https://www.rocket.chat/trial-saas](https://www.rocket.chat/trial-saas). Enter the following details:

1. **Organization Email**: Provide an organization email ID. This is required to access Rocket.Chat cloud and verification emails. It cannot be a personal email ID.
2. **Workspace name**: Enter a name for your workspace.
3. **Workspace URL**: The field is filled automatically according to the **Workspace name**.&#x20;
   1. You can edit the URL according to your requirements.&#x20;
   2. Dots are not allowed in the URL.
   3. By default, trial workspace URLs have the `rocket.chat` extension.
4. Server region: Select the server region where you want to host the trial workspace, `US` or `EU`.
5. **Language**: Select the language of your choice.
6. Select the privacy policy checkbox and submit the form.

Once the form is submitted, you will receive a confirmation email on the **Organization Email** that you provided. Confirm the email and the trial workspace is launched in a new tab. It may take a few minutes for the launch to be complete. As the first user on the workspace, you are assigned the `admin` [role](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/roles-in-rocket.chat).&#x20;

Let's take a brief look at the initial actions you can take:

* [Add and manage users](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users).
* Create different types of [rooms](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms) and [communicate](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/user-guides/messages) with your workspace users.
* [Manage your workspace](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration) features and settings as an admin.
