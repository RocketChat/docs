# Enterprise Support and Version Durability

{% hint style="success" %}
**Rocket.Chat 6.0** is our most secure and scalable version yet. It includes 10 security patches, 9 brand-new features, and 25+ overall platform enhancements. Visit our [website](https://www.rocket.chat/six) to learn more about whatâ€™s new in this latest version. [Update now](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/updating-rocket.chat)!
{% endhint %}

### **Requirements for Official Support**

* Rocket.Chat 6.0 is the latest, most secure, and scalable version, featuring security patches, new features, and platform enhancements.
* To obtain official support, installations must meet specific requirements, ensuring that the support request pertains to the Rocket.Chat application and not external factors. The installation should run the Docker image provided by the Rocket.Chat team to ensure this.

### **Supported Environment**

* Rocket.Chat requires the installation to run on their Docker image to isolate external factors. This approach ensures efficient support by avoiding issues like:
  1. Compilation problems.
  2. Installation issues.
  3. Missing or outdated dependencies.
  4. Use of non-official versions.

{% endcontent-ref %}

**Rocket.Chat Versions**

* Legacy server versions are being deprecated. To continue using mobile and desktop applications and access cloud services after October 1, 2023, workspaces must stay within the supported window.
* Rocket.Chat will support the prior minor release for 3 months and the prior major release for 6 months. For instance, version 1.2.x will be supported for 3 months after the release of 1.3.0. Version 1.3.x will be supported for 6 months after the release of 2.0.0.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are deprecating cloud services, mobile and desktop applications for legacy server versions with the introduction of the new policy, which will take effect on **October 1, 2023**. For all the Community and Enterprise workspaces to continue using our mobile and desktop applications and access cloud services after October 1st, they must stay within the supported window.
{% endhint %}

By support, we mean that Rocket.Chat will provide only security fixes and answer support tickets related to configuration and usage for the below-mentioned versions. Bugs not related to security issues will be fixed only in new versions.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of security-relevant bugs, we might decide to backport patches to older releases on a case-by-case basis. Please understand, though, that those will be rare exceptions. If you want to play it safe, upgrade to the latest stable.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always update to the latest stable version before reporting any bugs or before asking for help from the community.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**LTS** means **Long Term Support** and it's used to identify the last **minor** version before a **major** version, e.g. 2.4 is the last minor before 3.x. A new major version means that the version introduced a breaking change and requires attention on the upgrade, so we maintain the support of the previous version for a longer time in order to give you more time to plan and test the upgrade.
{% endhint %}

### Rocket.Chat Cloud

Rocket.Chat manages upgrades for Cloud users regardless of the release version. Outdated server versions might be upgraded to the latest stable version for optimal performance.

### Rocket.Chat Services

Services such as the push gateway and marketplace are managed by Rocket.Chat. Three months after a new major release, the last major release will have its Services support deprecated. Five months post-deprecation, support will be removed, leading to potential errors and warnings about incompatibility.

{% hint style="info" %}
October 1, 2023 will be the sunset date for allowing connections between our cloud services, official mobile and desktop apps and workspaces running legacy versions of Rocket.Chat that are outside of our Long Time Support (LTS) window.
{% endhint %}

#### **What should you do before the end of the deprecation period?**

Before the end of the deprecation period, we strongly recommend all the workspaces on Community and Enterprise editions to upgrade to a supported version (version 6.0.0 or higher) for continued access to cloud services, mobile and desktop apps. If you do not wish to upgrade, Rocket.Chat provides workspace owners with a variety of options for managing their workspaces in the manner of your choosing. If you choose to remain on a version of Rocket.Chat that is outside of our LTS, you must implement the following alternatives to our cloud services and published apps:

* **Mobile and desktop apps:** You must compile each app from our open-source code and publish your own builds to relevant app stores.
* **Push notifications:** You will need to deploy your own push notification server.
* **Apps:** You will be required to develop and sideload your own applications instead of installing them through our Marketplace.

### MongoDB versions

Each Rocket.Chat release supports different MongoDB versions. It's essential to follow the official MongoDB documentation for upgrade guides, ensuring no versions are skipped during the upgrade process.

> Rocket.Chat only adds or removes support of MongoDB versions on major releases so the minor versions are ommited on table below.

The upgrade guides available from the official MongoDB documentation are listed below. Bear in mind that it's not possible to skip a version when upgrading, e.g. to upgrade from 3.2 to 3.6 it's necessary to upgrade from 3.2 to 3.4 first and then to 3.6.

* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 3.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 3.6](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 4.0](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 4.2](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 4.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.4-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 5.0](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
* [Upgrade Replicat Set to 6.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set/)

> It's possible to bypass the MongoDB version check by using the environment variable `BYPASS_MONGO_VALIDATION=true`. Bare in mind that this work around should be used only when extrictly necessary and may prevent some functionalities to work properly or even prevent the server to start.

### Browser versions

Support is limited to recent browsers due to the rapid evolution in the browser ecosystem. Supported browsers include the latest three versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, the latest two versions of Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge, and the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer.
