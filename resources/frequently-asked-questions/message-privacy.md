<summary>Is it possible for my workspace Administrator to access or view any data or messages in a channel even if they are not a member of that particular channel?</summary>

No, messages in a channel or chat can only be seen by users who are members of that channel. However, if a workspace has Auditor roles, they have the ability to view all messages in the audit panel. If [message-auditor](../../use-rocket.chat/user-management/message-auditor/ "mention") is enabled, any auditor who audits messages will generate [audit-logs.md](../../use-rocket.chat/user-management/message-auditor/audit-logs.md "mention") that can be reviewed by other auditors. If you use [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) ](../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/security-bundle/end-to-end-encryption-user-guide.md)or [off-the-record messaging](../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/messages/off-the-record-otr-messaging-user-guide.md), even auditors do not have the ability to view those messages.

<summary>Are messages stored in Rocket.Chat logs files?</summary>
