# Trial FAQ

## **Why have I been given a trial on my community plan workspace?**

At Rocket.Chat, we are committed to enhancing your communication experience and offering you a glimpse into the advanced features available with our premium plans. As a user of the Community plan, you have been automatically granted a 30-day trial of our Enterprise and Pro plans. This trial is part of our initiative to provide an immersive experience, allowing you to explore the robust capabilities and enhanced security features of our premium offerings.

**Key Benefits of the Trial:**

1. **Hands-On Experience:** The trial period is an excellent opportunity for you to experience firsthand how Rocket.Chat's advanced features can drive better team collaboration, streamline processes, and elevate communication within your organization.
2. **Post-Trial Options:** After enjoying the extensive features during the trial, your workspace automatically returns to the [Starter plan](../../../readme/our-plans.md#starter-plan), ensuring a seamless transition. But, if you have exceeded the limits of the Starter plan, your workspace returns to [Community](../../../readme/our-plans.md#community).
3. **Additional Trials on Updates:** To keep you updated with the latest advancements, we offer an additional 30-day trial period every time your workspace is updated to a new major version. This ensures you continuously explore and stay informed about our evolving features.
4. **Extended Trial Requests:** If you find yourself needing more time to evaluate our premium plans, feel free to contact our sales team. We are open to analyzing requests for additional trial time to ensure a tailored evaluation process that meets your specific needs.
5. **Reverting to Community Edition:** Should you decide that the Community Edition aligns best with your current needs, reverting is straightforward. Kindly consult [#cancel-workspace-subscription](../../../setup-and-configure/license-application.md#cancel-workspace-subscription "mention") remove the license and revert to the Community Edition.

We encourage you to take full advantage of this trial period to explore the enhanced functionalities and benefits that come with Rocket.Chat's premium plans.
