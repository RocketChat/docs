# Deploy with Kubernetes

Using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager, the [helm chart](https://github.com/RocketChat/helm-charts/tree/master/rocketchat) bootstraps a Rocket.Chat deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster. It provisions a fully featured Rocket.Chat installation. Additionally, this chart supports the [scaling of Rocket.Chat](../scaling-rocket.chat/) for increased server capacity and high availability.

## Prerequisites Details

The chart has an optional dependency on the [MongoDB](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) chart. By default, the MongoDB chart requires PV support on underlying infrastructure which may be disabled.

## Installing the Chart

Confirm that you have helm3 binary insalled, then add the chart repository with the following command:

```
helm repo add rocketchat https://rocketchat.github.io/helm-charts
```

To install the chart ,you can either define your configuration options in a values file or pass the configuration parameters via command line arguments.

### Define the configuations value in a file

We recommend defining the configuration parameters inside a `Values.yaml` file with at least the non-root user's password and the root password before passing it to helm. You must set at least the database and root password in the values file.

```
mongodb:
  auth:
    passwords:
      - rocketchat
    rootPassword: rocketchatroot
```

Now, install with the following command:

```
helm install rocketchat -f Values.yaml rocketchat/rocketchat
```

### Set the configurations parameters via command line arguments

Optionally, you can use the `--set` flag to pass the configuration parameters to helm.

```
helm install rocketchat rocketchat/rocketchat --set mongodb.auth.passwords={$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32))},mongodb.auth.rootPassword=$(echo -n $(openssl rand -base64 32))
```

> Starting from chart version 5.4.3, username, password, and database entries must be arrays of the same length due to MongoDB dependency. Rocket.Chat will use the first entries of those arrays for its own use. `mongodb.auth.usernames` array defaults to `{rocketchat}` and `mongodb.auth.databases` array defaults to `{rocketchat}.`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `rocketchat` deployment:

```
helm delete rocketchat
```

### Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Rocket.Chat chart and their default values.

The default value "soft" means that the scheduler should _prefer_ to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node but no guarantee is provided. The value "hard" means that the scheduler is _required_ to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node. The value "" will disable pod anti-affinity so that no anti-affinity rules will be configured. | `""`                                          |
| `podAntiAffinityTopologyKey`           | If anti-affinity is enabled sets the topologyKey to use for anti-affinity.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. Alternatively, you can update the YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters to be provided while installing the chart.

## Database Setup

Rocket.Chat uses a MongoDB instance to presist its data. By default, the [MongoDB](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) chart is deployed, and a single MongoDB instance is created as the primary in a replicaset.\
Please refer to [this chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mongodb) for additional MongoDB configuration options. If you are using chart defaults, set the `mongodb.auth.rootPassword` and `mongodb.auth.passwords`.

### **Using an External Database**

This chart supports using an existing MongoDB instance. Use the [configuration ](deploy-with-kubernetes.md#configuration)options and disable the chart's MongoDB with `--set mongodb.enabled=false`

### Configuring Additional Environment Variables

```
extraEnv: |
  - name: MONGO_OPTIONS
    value: '{"ssl": "true"}'
```

### Specifying aditional volumes

Sometimes, it's necessary to include extra sets of files by means of exposing them to the container as a mountpoint. The most common use case is the inclusion of SSL CA certificates.

```
extraVolumes: 
  - name: etc-certs
    hostPath:
    - path: /etc/ssl/certs
      type: Directory
extraVolumeMounts: 
  - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs
    name: etc-certs   
    readOnly: true
```

### Increasing Server Capacity and HA Setup ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Premium.svg)

To increase the server's capacity, you can increase the number of Rocket.Chat server instances across available computing resources in your cluster. For example,

```
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/rocketchat
```

By default, the chart creates one MongoDB instance as a Primary in a replicaset. You can also scale up the capacity and availability of the MongoDB cluster independently.

> See [MongoDB chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) for configuration information. To learn more on running Rocket.Chat in scaled configurations, visit the [Configure MongoDB Replicaset](../../../setup-and-configure/environment-configuration/mongodb-configuration/mongo-replicas.md) guide.

### Manage MongoDB secrets

The chart provides several ways to manage the connection for MongoDB apart from the primary `mongodb.auth` values. They include:

* Values passed to the chart (externalMongodbUrl, externalMongodbOplogUrl)
* An ExistingMongodbSecret containing the MongoURL and MongoOplogURL

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mongo-uri: mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/rocketchat
  mongo-oplog-uri: mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/local?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin
```

### Upgrading

### To 5.4.3

Due to changes on the upstream MongoDB chart, some deprecated variables have been renamed, which changed how this chart generates its manifests. Here are the values that need updates:

* `mongodb.auth.username` is no longer supported and has been changed to `mongodb.auth.usernames` array. If you set it to something custom (defaults to `rocketchat`), make sure you update it to an array, and the entry is the **first** entry in that array, as that's what Rocket.Chat will use to connect to the database.
* `mongodb.auth.password` is no longer supported and has been changed to `mongodb.auth.passwords` array. Update your values file to make it an array, and ensure it's the first entry of that array.
* `mongodb.auth.database` is no longer supported and has been changed to `mongodb.auth.databases`. Update your values file, convert it to an array, and ensure it's the first entry of that array.
* `mongodb.auth.rootUsername` and `mongodb.auth.rootPassword` remain the same.

> _`usernames`, `passwords` and `databases` arrays must be of the same length. Rocket.Chat chart will use the first entry for its mongodb connection string in `MONGO_URL` and `MONGO_OPLOG_URL`._

The used image tag gets updated **in most cases** on each chart update. The same is true for the MongoDB chart we use as our dependency. Before version 5.4.3, we used the chart version 10.x.x. Starting from 5.4.3, the dependency chart version has been updated to the latest available version, 13.x.x. This chart defaults to MongoDB 6.0.x at the moment.

> As a warning, this chart will not handle MongoDB upgrades and will depend on the user to ensure the supprted version is runnning.

The upgrade will fail if any of the following requirements are not met :

* Must not skip a MongoDB release. For example, 4.2.x to 5.0.x will fail.
* Current `featureCompatibilityVersion` must be compatible with the version the user is trying to upgrade to. For example—if the current database version and feature compatibility is 4.4 and 4.2, respectively, but the user is trying to upgrade to 5.0, it'll fail.

The chart will not check if the mongodb version is supported by the Rocket.Chat version considering deployments that might occur in an airgapped environment. You can check the[ release notes](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) to confirm that.

To get the currently deployed MongoDB version, the easiest method is to get into the mongo shell and run `db.version()`. You are advised to pin your MongoDB dependency in the values file.

```
mongodb:
  image:
    tag: # find from https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mongodb/tags
```
