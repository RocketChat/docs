# Deploy with Docker & Docker Compose

{% hint style="info" %}
As of December 15, 2023, Rocket.Chat has ceased support for connections from cloud services and official mobile/desktop apps to workspaces running legacy versions outside our support window. Users on unsupported legacy servers are advised to upgrade to the latest Rocket.Chat version to ensure continued access to cloud, mobile, and desktop applications. **Each Rocket.Chat version is supported for six months post-release.**
{% endhint %}

Deploying Rocket.Chat with Docker and Docker Compose is a straightforward and highly recommended deployment method due to its simplicity and flexibility. This guide will walk you through the essential steps, whether you're a seasoned Docker expert or new to containerization, ensuring a smooth deployment for your Rocket.Chat workspace.

**In this guide, you'll learn how to:**

* [Install Docker and Docker Compose](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#preparation-steps)
* [Deploy Rocket.Chat on Docker](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#deploy-rocket.chat-on-docker)
* [Update Rocket.Chat on Docker](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#updating-rocket.chat-on-docker)
* [Enable HTTPs with Docker deployment](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#enable-https)
* [Backup and Restore Docker Mongo](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#docker-mongo-backup-and-restore)

## Preparation Steps

**Installing Docker and Docker Compose**

* Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2 is required) installed and operational. If you don't have them installed, you can conveniently set them up using Docker's official helper script:

```bash
curl -L https://get.docker.com | sh
```

* To run Docker commands without using sudo, add the current user to the Docker group and then reboot using the following commands:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot
```

## Deploy Rocket.Chat on Docker

**Fetching Compose file**

* Navigate to your preferred directory and create a `compose.yml` file following [our example](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/master/compose.yml). Alternatively, you can use the `curl` command to download the example `compose.yml` file by executing this command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/master/compose.yml -O
```

**Editing Environment Variables**

Modifying the configurations in the compose file directly is strongly discouraged. Instead, use environment variables. You can set environment variables using a `.env` file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to uncomment the variables you are updating in the `.env` file.
{% endhint %}

* In your project directory, create a `.env` file with this command and paste the contents of [this example file](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/master/env.example)

```
nano .env
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you cloned the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/tree/master), you can copy the `.env.example` to `.env` with this command:

```
cp env.example .env
```
{% endhint %}

* Set the `RELEASE` variable in the `.env`to your desired Rocket.Chat version.

{% hint style="info" %}
See our [releases page](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) and [available docker images.](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#rocket.chat-docker-images) Keeping the default release as`latest` is **not recommended.**
{% endhint %}

* Edit `ROOT_URL` from the default `http://localhost:3000` to match your domain name or IP address if you're deploying a production workspace.
* If you have a registration token to register the workspace automatically, you can add it to the `.env` file like this:

```
REG_TOKEN={your token here}
```

* If you are using MongoDB Atlas as the database provider, edit the value of the `MONGO_URL` variable to be your connection string in this format:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://<user>:<pass>@host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/<databaseName>?replicaSet=<replicaSet>&ssl=true&authSource=admin
```

* Save the `.env` file and start up the container by executing this command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:

* Start a MongoDB service named `mongodb`.
* Start a service `rocketchat`, which will also wait for `mongodb` to be ready.

{% hint style="info" %}
MongoDB ensures continuous 24 x 7 operations and live backup, reducing the need for frequent restarts. Refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/) for proper server operation and management. Optionally, manage messages and configurations by uncommenting the volume mounts, and ensuring a data subdirectory is available for data storage and mounting.
{% endhint %}

Once the container is running, visit _http://localhost:3000_ or your domain on the browser. You can now explore your Rocket.Chat workspace and [invite other users](https://docs.rocket.chat/setup-and-configure/accessing-your-workspace).

**Start & Stop Docker Compose**

To stop your workspace from running, execute this command:

```
docker compose down
```

To start your docker-compose container, run this command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

To see the log/status of your Rocket.Chat container, execute this command:

```
docker compose logs -f rocketchat
```

## Rocket.Chat Docker Images

**Official image (stable and tested)**

The [Official Docker Images Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/rocket.chat/tags) is responsible for maintaining and controlling Rocket.Chat's official stable image through Docker. It is also reviewed by the Docker committee.

```bash
docker pull registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat
```

**Latest Release Image**

This is an image that holds the latest stable Rocket.Chat updates on the docker repository. The release may be from the `develop` or `master` branch.

```bash
docker pull registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest
```

**Preview Image**

The Rocket.Chat preview image deploys a container with a database inside. It's useful for quickly trying or running tests, not requiring a dedicated database installation.

{% embed url="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/rocket.chat.preview" %}

**Specific Release Image**

You can set up your Rocket.Chat workspace with a specific [release](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) image. Select the release you need from the [docker hub tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/rocket.chat/tags/) and use it to run the following command:

```bash
docker pull registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat:<release-tag>
```

**Bleeding-edge untested develop build image**

This is an image maintained at Rocket.Chat's docker repository was updated from the `develop` (untested) branch, containing the latest updates for those who want to work with the newest features.

```bash
docker pull registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat:develop
```

## Updating Rocket.Chat on Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you proceed, see the [general guidelines for updating Rocket.Chat](updating-rocket.chat.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Updating the Rocket.Chat image doesn't affect your data since it exists in the Mongo image. Ensure that the version of your MongoDB is compatible with the intended [release](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) before proceeding with the update.
{% endhint %}

Using Docker & Docker compose, you can update your `rocketchat` docker image to the latest or preferred version of Rocket.Chat.

To update your Rocket.Chat version,

* For a specific version, modify the `RELEASE` variable in the `.env` file to point to the [docker image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/rocket.chat/tags/) of that version. Alternatively, you can edit the `compose.yml` file to point to the desired Rocket.Chat version.

<details>

<summary>Changing version in <code>.env</code></summary>

In the [`.env`](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/master/env.example) file, change the `RELEASE` value to your specified version.

```
RELEASE=<desired version>
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Changing version in <code>compose.yml</code></summary>

In the [`compose.yml`](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/master/compose.yml) file, change the `rocketchat` service `image` value to point to an image in the rocketchat registry image with a [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/rocket.chat/tags/) of your desired version.

```
services:
  rocketchat:
    image:registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat:<desired version>
```

</details>

* For the latest version, use `latest` as the `RELEASE` variable in the `.env` file. Alternatively, you can pull the Rocket.Chat image directly with the `latest` tag with this command:

```
docker pull registry.rocket.chat/rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest
```

* Now, stop, remove and restart the existing container with these commands:

```
docker compose stop rocketchat
docker compose rm rocketchat
docker compose up -d rocketchat
```

{% hint style="info" %}
See [#rocket.chat-docker-images](deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md#rocket.chat-docker-images "mention") for more details on Rocket.Chat docker images.
{% endhint %}

## Enable HTTPs

You can secure your Rocket.Chat docker instance with TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. Using Traefik as a reverse proxy, the certificates are automatically generated, enabling safe access to your Rocket.Chat instance via HTTPS on your specified domain.

To get HTTPS, ensure the correct A record (optionally CNAME) is set for your domain going to your server IP.

* Update the following variables in your `.env` file. If you don't have one, create a .env file following [our example](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/master/env.example).
  * `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: Your required email for the TLS certificates.
  * `DOMAIN`: Your domain or subdomain name only. Avoid adding https:// or any trailing slashes. Confirm that this domain resolves to the server IP address.
  * `RELEASE` : Your preferred Rocket.Chat release. See the [releases page](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases) to know more about our releases.
  * `ROOT_URL` : Set the value to "[https://your-domain.com](https://your-domain.com/)," replacing "your-domain.com" with the domain name you want to use.
  * `BIND_IP`: Set to `127.0.0.1` .

```
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL= # your email, required for the tls certificates
# set this to your domain name or subdomain, not trailing slashes or https://, just the domain
# make sure it actually resolves to your droplet ip
DOMAIN= 
RELEASE= # pin the rocketchat version, at the time of writing, prefer 6.0.0
ROOT_URL= # set this to https://${DOMAIN} replace ${DOMAIN} with the actual domain
BIND_IP=127.0.0.1
```

* Download the traefik template by running the following command:

```
curl -LO \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/master/traefik.yml
```

* Recreate the existing Rocket.Chat container

```
docker compose up -d rocketchat --force-recreate
```

* Star traefik

```
docker compose -f traefik.yml up -d
```

Wait for the TLS certificates to generate and Rocket.Chat to restart. Then, access your Rocket.Chat instance securely at _https://your-domain.com,_ using the actual domain name you configured.

## Docker Mongo Backup and Restore

**To back up your MongoDB database in docker**,

* Run the following command on your terminal to list out all running containers:

```
docker ps -a
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Take note of your mongo container name.
{% endhint %}

* Run this command to dump the database into a binary file `db.dump`

```
docker exec <container_name> sh -c 'mongodump --archive' > db.dump
```

When successful, you should see `db.dump` file in the current directory.

**To restore the backup**, run the following command:

```
docker exec -i <container_name> sh -c 'mongorestore --archive' < db.dump
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can export your database dump directly to MongoDB Atlas by simply running

`mongorestore --uri mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.w2btl.mongodb.net --archive=db.dump`
{% endhint %}
