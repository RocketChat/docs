You must enable the [Omnichannel ](../../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/)feature with [agents](../../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/agents.md) and [managers ](../../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/managers.md)assigned to receive and send Omnichannel messages.
{% endhint %}

* Launch the WhatsApp app on your phone while logged in with a verified phone number to receive messages from your app.
* Send a message to the test number provided or your WhatsApp business number (if you added any).
* The message is seen in your Rocket.Chat server, available for any [Omnichannel Agent](../../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/agents.md) to **Take** the conversation.
* You can respond to the customer from your workspace, and they receive the response on Whatsapp.
