# Using the Mod Perspective app

After you have installed and configured the app, it starts screening the rooms that you have selected and moderating the messages based on the settings. If an inappropriate message is detected, the following actions will be performed:&#x20;

* The app will display a warning message that's only visible to the sender. The message is blocked or deleted if the settings are enabled.
* The message gets reported automatically. View the reports from the [**Moderation**](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/moderation) dashboard. The message and the sender's details are displayed in the reports.
* The app only detects, reports, and notifies users of inappropriate content. The workspace administrator or moderators can take appropriate actions according to the organization's guidelines, like deleting the messages or deactivating the user from the moderation dashboard.
