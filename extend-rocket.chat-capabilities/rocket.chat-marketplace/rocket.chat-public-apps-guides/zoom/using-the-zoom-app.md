# Using the Zoom App

To use the Zoom app in a [room](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms.md),

* Run the slash command `/zoom start` to generate a new Zoom meeting link. It generates a Zoom meeting link, and anyone in that room can click the link to join the meeting.
* You can also run `/zoom start <topic>` to add a title to the meeting. For example, `/zoom start Designers Daily Standup`. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
No one can join the call until the host signs in and admits others.
{% endhint %}
