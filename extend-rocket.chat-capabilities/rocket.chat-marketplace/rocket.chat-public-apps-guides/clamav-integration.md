# Antivirus ClamAV App

The ClamAV app enables forwarding uploaded files to an open-source antivirus (ClamAV) application that prevents the upload from completing in Rocket.Chat if a virus is detected. You have to install and run the ClamAV server, and then the ClamAV app connects to it.

It works across web browsers, desktop apps, and mobile apps. It is used to prevent users from spreading viruses and malware via Rocket.Chat. It is an open-source (GPL) antivirus engine used in various situations, including email scanning, web scanning, and endpoint security. It provides several utilities, including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command-line scanner, and an advanced tool for automatic database updates.
