# Using the Mod Assist App

* After installing and configuring the app, it will start screening the selected channels and moderating the contents based on the rules you have defined. If an inappropriate message is detected, the following actions will be performed:&#x20;
  * The app will display a warning message that's only visible to the sender.
  * The message will automatically get reported. You can view the reports in the [Moderation Dashboard](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/moderation.md). All the details of the reported message, such as sender, date, etc., will also be displayed in the **Moderation Reports** automatically.&#x20;
  * The workspace administrator and the moderator can take appropriate actions from the **Moderation Dashboard**. For more details on the supported actions, please refer to our [Moderation documentation](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/moderation.md).

The Mod Assist app only detects, reports, and notifies users of inappropriate content. From the reports, the workspace moderators and administrators can carry out the appropriate [moderation actions](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/moderation.md) like deleting the reported messages, deactivating the reported user, etc.
