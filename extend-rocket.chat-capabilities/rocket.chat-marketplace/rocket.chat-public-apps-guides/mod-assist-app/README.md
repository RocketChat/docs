Content moderation is vital for maintaining a safe, inclusive digital workspace. It serves to uphold user safety by filtering harmful content like spam and hate speech, preserving brand reputation as a secure platform, and complying with legal regulations on content removal. Manual moderation is increasingly impractical due to the volume of conversations and the psychological risks to human moderators.&#x20;

The Mod Assist app automates this process, offering an efficient, scalable solution for content moderation. It enhances digital workspace security by automating key moderation tasks. It detects harmful content based on predefined rules, flags and reports these messages for moderator review, and enriches reports with contextual details like sender information, room location, and timestamps. This streamlines the moderation process and provides comprehensive data for informed decision-making.

  * **Moderate accounts created in the past (number in days):** This setting enables the app to moderate messages from accounts created within a specific number of days.  For example, if you set a 30-day period, the app will moderate the message if the sender's account was created within the last 30 days. Messages from accounts created prior to this timeframe will bypass moderation.
