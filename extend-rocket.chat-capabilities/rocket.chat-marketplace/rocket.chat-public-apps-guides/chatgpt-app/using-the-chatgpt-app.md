# Using the ChatGPT App

Upon successful installation and configuration of the ChatGPT app, users can seamlessly engage with ChatGPT in their  workspace through real-time conversations, offering a substantial boost to productivity and efficiency.

You can access the ChatGPT app in your workspace via the following methods:

**Message Box Options**

* From the message box in a [room](../../../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/), click the **+ icon.**&#x20;
* Navigate to **Apps** and select **ChatGPT**.

**Direct Message**

You can [create a 1:1 DM](../../../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/create-a-new-direct-message.md#create-a-new-direct-message-1-1) with the _chatgpt.bot_ user. You can also [create multi-user DMs](../../../../use-rocket.chat/user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/create-a-new-direct-message.md#create-a-new-multi-user-direct-message-1-m) with the _chatgpt.bot_ and other users in your workspace.

To use the ChatGPT app, you'll need to provide both a **prompt** and a **message**. The prompt serves as instructions for the message you're sending, and each query response is organized into a thread. This allows you to manage multiple simultaneous conversations with the ChatGPT app.

#### ChatGPT Prompt Examples

Selecting the right prompts is essential to achieve desirable results with the ChatGPT app. Consider using more detailed instructions when basic commands are insufficient. Here are some prompt suggestions for getting started with ChatGPT:

#### Prompt 1: Simplifying complex notions

**Example:** I want to learn about (insert specific topic). Explain (insert specific topic) to me like I'm 11 years old.

#### Prompt 2: Summarize text intelligently

**Example:** (Insert article/book/news) Summarize this entire text into five sentences.&#x20;

#### Prompt 3: Stay current without leaving Rocket.Chat&#x20;

**Example:** Help me stay updated on the latest developments and trends in (topic). What are some trustworthy resources I can follow to stay informed?
