Due to Atlassian's decision to deprecate its server products, the Confluence server app is no longer supported in the latest versions of Rocket.Chat and will be ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Deprecated (1).png>)
{% endhint %}

## Install Confluence Server App

To install the Confluence Server App,

* Navigate to **Administration > Apps > Marketplace.**
* Search for the **Confluence Server** **Integration** app.
* Click **Install.**
* **Agree** to the permissions to confirm the installation.

## Configure Confluence Server App

{% hint style="info" %}
Confirm that you have the  [Rocket.Chat for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220180/rocket-chat-for-confluence) add-on installed on your Confluence server.
{% endhint %}

To configure the Confluence Server App,

* Navigate to any [room ](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms.md)and run the slash command  `/confluence-server install CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL USER PASSWORD`, where:
  * **CONFLUENCE\_BASE\_URL:** The base URL of your Confluence server. Navigate to **Confluence administration** > **General Configuration.**
  * **USER:** The username of a user with administrative privileges in your Confluence server.
  * **PASSWORD:** The password of the user mentioned above.
* Now your Rocket.Chat workspace is connected to the Confluence server instance.
* Add the **@rocket.cat user** to the room and assign permission to write messages.
