# Using the Anonymizer App

After [installing and configuring the Anonymizer app](./) in your workspace, inform the users in the configured **members' room** that they can send anonymous messages through the bot. Whenever they send a direct message to that bot_**,**_ the bot anonymously forwards the message to the specified room without revealing the sender's identity. If a user is not in the configured **members' room,** any message they send to the bot is ignored.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
* The custom bot must be a room member where the anonymous messages are forwarded; otherwise, the messages won't be forwarded.
* If your custom bot isn't forwarding the anonymous messages, try disabling and enabling the Anonymizer app after updating the settings.
{% endhint %}
