# Privacy Notice for Air-Gapped Workspaces

**Effective Date:** December 9th, 2023

This document serves as a privacy notice for users of [air-gapped workspaces](../../../setup-and-configure/rocket.chat-air-gapped-deployment/). These workspaces are isolated from external networks, including the internet, and therefore do not register with Rocket.Chat's cloud services. In this document, we aim to clarify the data handling practices within these environments.&#x20;

### **Definition of Air-Gapped Environments**

An air-gapped environment is a secure workspace or system, deliberately disconnected from external networks to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### **Data Collection and Usage in Air-Gapped Environments**

In air-gapped environments, Rocket.Chat adheres to strict data privacy standards by not collecting:

* **Account Data:** Information such as usernames, email addresses, or passwords.
* **Usage Data:** Details on how users interact with the software.
* **App Data:** Information about applications or services operating within the air-gapped environment.
* **User Content:** Any content created or uploaded by users.
* **Tracking or Cookies:** No tracking technologies or cookies are employed to gather user information

### **Limitations of Air-Gapped Licenses**

Users should be aware of certain limitations inherent to air-gapped licenses:

* **Absence of Cloud Services:** Features like the marketplace, OmniGateway, push notifications, and other cloud-dependent add-ons are unavailable.

### **Transition to Registered Environments**

Should an air-gapped environment opt to register with Rocket.Chat, the data collection practices outlined [here](../../../privacy-and-security/privacy-and-security-policies/rocket.chat-privacy-policy/#the-distinction-of-data-collection-between-self-hosted-workspaces-and-cloud-hosting-workspaces) will become applicable.
