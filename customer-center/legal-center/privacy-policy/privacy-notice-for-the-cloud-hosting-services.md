This document is a supplementary guide to our main Privacy Policy. It provides additional details and insights into how we manage your personal information under our **Cloud Hosting Services.**&#x20;

For our Cloud Hosting Services, we act as a Data Processor for our Customers, who are the Data Controllers of the instances they have licensed and administer. As a User, you will be bound by the Data Controller´s policies. For these instances, please direct your data privacy questions to the Data Controller.

Regarding some of our Cloud Products, Customers have certain options to select the processing location of data and configure the instance's privacy-relevant settings. If you are the Customer of one of these instances, you can contact us and get more information on where your instance is running.

We generally offer two regions:

* hosting in the United States
* hosting in the European Union

Other regions may be added over time.

The amount of Personal Data we process with our Cloud Hosting Services is limited to what the Customer and his users enter into the Service. In the Cloud hosting services, we will not process the personalized cookie or analytics data described above. The purposes of processing the data are strictly limited to providing and improving the Service in accordance with the Data Controller´s instructions. We never access workspace data (i.e. the actual content the customer is entering in his instance) unless the customer asks us to in the form of a support request, we are bound by a valid law enforcement request or to protect our own interests, such as investigating potential abuse of the service.

Once your usage of our cloud hosting services ceases, we will remove all your data, including backups, after a short grace period - or immediately if you tell us to.
