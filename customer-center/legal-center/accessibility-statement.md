# Accessibility statement

**Last Updated: October 19, 2023**

Rocket.Chat is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We aim to continually improve the user experience for everyone and strive to make our digital services as accessible as possible under the BITV 2.0 (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung 2.0) guidelines.

### Accessibility standards

Our digital services adhere to Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. These guidelines outline how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments.

### Accessibility features

* The platform offers light, dark, and high-contrast themes.
* Rocket.Chat complies with the minimum contrast ratio required by BITV 2.0 and WCAG 2.1.
* We ensure that each page has descriptive and meaningful titles.
* Adjustable font size.
* Input fields are designed to clearly convey their purpose, making it easier for users to understand how to interact with them.
* The platform ensures that information and functionality aren't reliant on color alone. For situations where color is the sole design tool, we provide tooltips or other mechanisms to clarify the intended meaning.
* Activation of accessibility features is accessible via a screen reader.
* Focus states meet BITV 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 criteria.
* The time format can be chosen to meet your preference.
* Information such as usernames and user roles can be hidden so screen readers skip unnecessary content.

### Ongoing efforts

We are continually working to improve the accessibility of our digital services, and we regularly review our communication platform to identify and address any potential accessibility issues. Our ongoing efforts include:

* Conducting regular accessibility assessments and audits.
* Training our staff on accessibility best practices.
* Reviewing the work done to ensure the accessibility practices are met.
* Monitoring compliance with BITV 2.0 standards and making necessary adjustments.

### Compatibility and browser support

Rocket.Chat aims to provide a consistent and accessible experience across various web browsers and platforms. However, there may be occasional variations due to factors beyond our control.

### Scope of application

Our commitment to accessibility applies specifically to the features and functionalities within the team collaboration product.

#### Third-party integrations and content

While our commitment is to ensure accessibility within the team collaboration product, we acknowledge that users may interact with third-party integrations, plugins, or content. These components are beyond our direct control, and their accessibility may vary. We encourage users to refer to the accessibility statements and resources provided by the respective third-party providers when using integrated features.

### Legal requirements

Rocket.Chat is committed to complying with legal requirements and standards related to digital accessibility, including those outlined in BITV 2.0 (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung 2.0). We recognize the importance of adhering to these regulations to ensure equitable access to our digital services for all individuals, regardless of disability.

#### BITV 2.0 compliance

Rocket.Chat is designed to conform to the requirements of BITV 2.0, which implements the European Union Web Accessibility Directive (EUWAD) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Our commitment to BITV 2.0 compliance reflects our dedication to providing accessible digital services.

Any known barriers to accessibility will be listed in this document.

#### Monitoring and ongoing compliance

We continually monitor and assess our digital services to maintain compliance with relevant legal requirements and accessibility standards. Our accessibility team conducts regular audits and evaluations to identify and address any areas where our product may fall short of the legal standards.

#### Feedback and reporting

If you believe that our product does not meet the legal requirements or if you have encountered accessibility barriers, please contact us using the provided contact information. Your feedback is instrumental in our efforts to ensure compliance and improve accessibility.

#### Commitment to accessibility beyond compliance

While compliance with legal requirements is a priority, our commitment to accessibility goes beyond mere adherence to the law. We strive to create an inclusive and welcoming digital environment that accommodates all users, regardless of their abilities.

#### External Audit by CCNET

As part of our commitment to accessibility, we engaged CCNET to conduct an independent audit of our platform. CCNET is legally recognized in the field of digital accessibility auditing and conducted a thorough evaluation of our product to ensure compliance with BITV 2.0 (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung 2.0).
